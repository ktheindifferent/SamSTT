# ThreadPoolExecutor Shutdown Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Fixed critical ThreadPoolExecutor resource leak in `stts/app.py` where the global executor was never properly shut down, causing memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Shutdown Handlers (`stts/app.py`)
- **atexit handler**: Ensures executor cleanup on normal exit
- **Signal handlers**: Handles SIGINT and SIGTERM for graceful shutdown
- **Shutdown function**: Implements two-phase shutdown (graceful then forced)

### 2. Sanic Application Lifecycle Hooks
- **before_server_start**: Initializes resources properly
- **after_server_stop**: Cleans up resources including pending async tasks

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- Duplicate shutdown prevention with `shutdown_initiated` flag
- Configurable shutdown timeout via `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` env var
- Graceful task completion before shutdown
- Forced cancellation fallback for hung tasks
- Comprehensive logging of shutdown process
- Proper cleanup of engine resources

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. **test_executor_shutdown.py**: Comprehensive test suite (requires dependencies)
2. **test_executor_shutdown_simple.py**: Simplified tests that run without full app dependencies

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Basic shutdown with completed tasks
- ✅ Shutdown with pending tasks (waits for completion)
- ✅ Forced shutdown for long-running tasks
- ✅ Duplicate shutdown prevention
- ✅ Concurrent task handling during shutdown
- ✅ Exception handling in tasks
- ✅ Thread cleanup verification
- ✅ Signal handler simulation

All 8 tests pass successfully!

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `MAX_ENGINE_WORKERS`: Number of ThreadPoolExecutor workers (default: 2)
- `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`: Maximum time to wait for graceful shutdown in seconds (default: 10.0)

## Benefits
1. **No more memory leaks**: Executor properly releases resources
2. **Graceful shutdown**: Pending requests complete before termination
3. **Signal handling**: Responds properly to SIGTERM/SIGINT
4. **Monitoring**: Detailed logging of shutdown process
5. **Robustness**: Fallback to forced shutdown if graceful fails

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files
- `stts/app.py`: Added shutdown handlers and lifecycle hooks

### New Files
- `test_executor_shutdown.py`: Full test suite
- `test_executor_shutdown_simple.py`: Simplified standalone tests
- `SHUTDOWN_FIX_SUMMARY.md`: This documentation

## Verification
Run the tests to verify the fix:
```bash
python3 test_executor_shutdown_simple.py
```

Expected output: All 8 tests passing ✅
