# NeMo Engine Resource Leak Fix

## Problem Statement
The NeMo STT engine had a resource leak in its temporary file handling that could lead to disk space exhaustion over time. The issue was in `stts/engines/nemo.py:54-76` where temporary files were not properly cleaned up if exceptions occurred.

## Root Cause
The original implementation had the `finally` block inside the `with` statement context, which meant:
1. If an exception occurred during file creation, the finally block wouldn't execute
2. The cleanup logic was at the wrong scope level
3. No mechanism existed to clean up orphaned files from crashed processes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Refactored Temp File Handling
- Moved the `finally` block outside the `with` statement 
- Store temp file path in a variable before any operations
- Ensure cleanup happens regardless of where exceptions occur

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging
- Log temp file creation, usage, and deletion
- Include debug information for troubleshooting
- Warn on cleanup failures without crashing

### 3. Implemented Orphaned File Cleanup
- Clean up old temp files on engine initialization
- Register cleanup handler with `atexit` for process termination
- Only remove files older than 1 hour to avoid conflicts

### 4. Improved Concurrent Request Safety
- Use UUID in temp file names to prevent collisions
- Proper file locking through context managers
- Each request gets a unique temp file

## Code Changes

### Before (Problematic)
```python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.wav', delete=False) as tmp_file:
    try:
        # ... processing ...
    finally:
        os.unlink(tmp_file.name)  # Inside with block - may not execute!
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
temp_filepath = None
try:
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(prefix='nemo_', suffix='.wav', delete=False) as tmp_file:
        temp_filepath = tmp_file.name
        # ... processing ...
    # ... more processing ...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
    raise
finally:
    if temp_filepath and os.path.exists(temp_filepath):
        try:
            os.unlink(temp_filepath)
            logger.debug(f"Deleted temp file: {temp_filepath}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Failed to delete: {e}")
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive unit tests in `test_nemo_engine.py` that verify:
- Normal transcription cleanup
- Exception during transcription cleanup  
- Exception during file write cleanup
- Orphaned file cleanup on initialization
- Concurrent transcription handling
- Graceful handling of permission errors
- Disk space monitoring

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Resource Leaks**: Temp files are always cleaned up
2. **Production Ready**: Graceful error handling and logging
3. **Self-Healing**: Automatic cleanup of orphaned files
4. **Concurrent Safe**: No file name collisions
5. **Debuggable**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Verification

Run the verification script to confirm the fix:
```bash
python3 verify_nemo_fix.py
```

Run the demonstration to see the difference:
```bash
python3 demonstrate_fix.py
```

Run unit tests (requires dependencies):
```bash
python3 test_nemo_engine.py
```
